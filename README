## SQL Injection Detection

This project detects SQL injection attempts using a machine learning model.

### How it works

- `SQLi_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all code for data cleaning, model training, and saving the model.
- `backend/`: Flask API to serve predictions.
- `frontend/`: Simple HTML/JS/CSS frontend.

### How to use

1. **Train the model**
   - Open `SQLi_model.ipynb` and run all cells.
   - This will generate `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`.

2. **Run the backend**
   - Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start the server: `python app.py`

3. **Open the frontend**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

> **Note:** The repo does not include the trained model or data files. You must run the notebook to generate them.
